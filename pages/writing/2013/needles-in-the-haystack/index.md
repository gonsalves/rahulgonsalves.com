One of the most fun parts of my job is that I get to meet people who are solving interesting, real, problems in new markets on a regular basis. I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of seeing excitement go to idea to design to product and have participated in a small way in a few.

However, the chronic problem that I have in running a [small, boutique studio](http://uncommon.is), is the inability to take on all of the potential work that comes my way. At this point in time, we turn away about nine out of ten of the enquiries. We are typically booked out months in advance, which is frustrating for me, as I often get excited and energised about an idea or the people behind it, but aren&#8217;t able to match timelines. This is partly because of the way in which we work (one client at a time, minimum six-week billing cycles) but mostly because we haven&#8217;t been able to scale up.

Since good digital designers are in such short supply, it is doubly frustrating to see potentially amazing products shelved or worse still, mangled into oblivion by poor design choices.

To partly address that gap, and having had the privilege of working with a few exemplary designers and developers, I&#8217;m creating this list to serve as a starting point for anyone seeking design assistance in India (and further).

## Bardo

[Sathish Kumar&#8217;s modest website](http://www.bardo.in/projects.html) belies the depth of experience and quality of work that he does. He was one of my first design teachers, and I am more grateful than I can say for his advice and patience over the years.

## <del>Path Seventeen</del> _Now uncommon_

Pratul Kalia and Prateek Saxena are two of the most talented guys I know. It&#8217;s unfortunate that they almost always refuse to take up client work anymore, as they are working on [their own products](http://xvii.in/), but if you can convince them that what you are doing is worth their time&#8230;

I learned a lot and was extremely grateful for the attention to detail, and the strong aesthetic sense that [@lut4rp](http://twitter.com/lut4rp) brought in as I helped [@Flipkart](http://flipkart.com/) design their mobile applications.

## Miranj

Prateek ([@rungta](https://twitter.com/rungta) to his friends) and Souvik Das Gupta ([@souvikdg](https://twitter.com/souvikdg)) run [Miranj](http://miranj.in/), a web design and development studio based in Delhi. I worked with them whilst designing [RubyMonk](https://rubymonk.com/) for the amazing folks at [C42 Engineering](http://c42.in/) (who do things with a text editor which should be illegal). Prateek and Souvik are some of the most thoughtful \*people\* I know, and their work is exemplary. Go hire them.

## <del>3 Sided Coin</del> _Now uncommon_

Tejas Bhatt runs [3 Sided Coin](http://3sided.co.in/), and every single project he shows me nearly convinces me that I should hang up my boots and go home. They are constantly pushing the boundaries of what can be done within a browser, and their craft shows a deep understanding of the medium that is the internet. I have especially enjoyed the websites that they did for [the Monkey Bar](http://mobar.in/) (also a favourite place to eat) and [Like That Only](http://www.likethatonly.in/), a restaurant, which as it&#8217;s name indicates, could only be in Bangalore.

## <del>Horde Design</del> _Now uncommon_

I have tried hard to get [@arpancj](http://twitter.com/arpancj) to move to Bangalore and work with me, but to no avail. It was a pleasure working with him on [the Idea Device website](http://www.ideadevice.com/) &#8212; it was a relief to be able to paint broad brush strokes and to have someone else fill in the details. He is not just a designer, but an extremely competent web developer. See some [more of his work here](http://www.hordesoftware.com/).

## nth Loop

I letched at the beautiful pixels that [nth Loop](http://nthloop.com/) puts out. I was lucky enough to be able to catch [@Srivatsan](http://twitter.com/xrivatsan) while I was visting Bombay, and was super-impressed by the work he showed me. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing more of their work.

## Wink

[@arjunchetna](https://twitter.com/arjunchetna) and Pallavi Manchi run [Wink](http://wink.io/), a cheeky design studio based here in Bangalore. I&#8217;ve worked with them on graphic design projects and can attest to their promptness and professionalism. Their repertoire spans graphic design as well as design for physical products. My endorsement of them has nothing to do with the many boxes of chocolate they have sent me.

## Beard Design (AKA, the artist formerly known as [PPT Salon](http://www.pptsalon.com/))

Based just off the beach in Goa (the lucky bastards), [Beard Design](http://bearddesign.in/) turns &#8220;home-made saunf vodka&#8221; into beautiful branding and design projects. They have helped me out on a number of projects and I appreciate their graphic design skills.

## Ninan Joseph

Part of the first batch of students to graduate from the Srishti School of Art and Design, Ninan has been an old friend. He is an extremely skilled print and branding designer with a deep understanding of the intricacies of the medium. [His website](http://ninanjoseph.com/), while &#8220;Coming Soon&#8221; has his contact details.
