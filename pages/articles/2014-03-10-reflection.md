> Do you plan to continue in this job for the foreseeable future?

I went to a [relatively unusual school](https://cfl.in/ "Centre for Learning").It was small _(there were only sixty of us from the ages of six through eighteen)_ but had a large campus set in the shadow of a large mountain, next to aÂ  forest. The forest was filled with leopards, jackals, bears _(we found a dead one and proudly carried it back to school to dry out the carcass)_, **lots** of snakes and of course, a multitude of birds, trees and plants.

> Is your current job related to aspirations or dreams that you had as a young person?

Among the many unusual things that CFL does is their practice of retaining strong ties with their alumni. It is perhaps unsurprising given the strong relationships that build up over the years between teachers and students and I assumed it to be the norm but was soon disabused of that notion.

> Do you think anyone from any socio-economic background could be in your job today?

A couple weeks ago, as part of their General Studies program, a high school student _(Class XI)_ asked whether he could interview me as part of their course. The module is called **Livelihoods**, and the questions took me aback and set me a-thinking. The questions demand unflinchingly facing some hard truths and are perhaps ones that I should ask myself on a more regular basis. I reproduce them below.

>   1. What does your job involve? What is a typical day in your working life?
>   2. What were the steps that you took before you ended up in your current job? 
>       1. How long have you worked in your current job?
>       2. Have you changed many jobs? If so why?
>       3. Do you plan to continue in this job for the foreseeable future?
>       4. What was the process/training that you needed to get to where you are currently?
>       5. Is your current job related to aspirations or dreams that you had as a young person?
>       6. Do you think anyone from any socio-economic background could be in your job today?
>   3. What are the main factors that have influenced you in your choice of work? 
>       1. Status
>       2. Meaning/Fulfilment/Enjoyment
>       3. Financial Security
>   4. Was your choice of work associated with ideas of leading a particular lifestyle? 
>       1. Has this turned out in the manner you anticipated?
>       2. Do you feel that you are economically stable?
>       3. How has the recent economic recession affected your work?
>   5. What is your relationship to your work with regard to how you define yourself?
>   6. Is every moment of your job exciting and enjoyable? If not, how do you deal with the work that is 
>       1. monotonous, repetitive
>       2. stressful
>       3. other challenges
>   7. How do you balance your work life and personal/social life?
>   8. Do you think your job contributes to the community around you, or to the greater good?
>   9. How do you describe your work environment? 
>       1. Is there a hierarchy in your workplace and where do you place yourself in this hierarchy?
>       2. What is your relationship with your colleagues?
>  10. Do you consider your job as part of a larger economic network? How do you see this network?
>  11. What are the social and environmental impacts that you see of your job? Are social and environmental impacts important in making your livelihood choice?

They provided me with an opportunity for reflection; also prompted me to take a very hard look at what I currently do. I want to be able to look this seventeen-year old in the eye and tell him my work, that I spend upwards of sixty hours a week on, is meaningful and fulfilling, and that it contributes positively to the community around me.

It is, isn&#8217;t it?
