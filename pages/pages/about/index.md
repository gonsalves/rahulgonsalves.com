**Update:**
  
I joined hands with some of India&#8217;s best designers to found [Uncommon](http://uncommon.is/). Uncommon is an employee owned services cooperative. We design+build beautiful digital products.

In 2005, I founded [Pixelogue](http://pixelogue.in/), which grew into it&#8217;s current form: a bespoke design studio that builds elegant, accessible and standards-compliant websites which make a big impact.

I have been involved in promoting web and accessibility standards for the last five years and in addition to speaking on accessibility, conducts regular workshops on building accessible websites around India.

I have also been involved in the drafting of the National Policy on Electronic Accessibility for the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology as a member of the Core Group on Information Technology and Communications at the National Centre for the Promotion of Employment of Disabled Persons (NCPEDP).
